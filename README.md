# An Analysis of Citi Bikesharing

---

## Overview of Project
Proposal of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. We are able to solidify our proposal based on the following bike trip analysis for the success we've had in NYC that has been utilizing the program.

### Analysis of Data
In analyzing the data, we were able to view the trending success of the Citi Bikesharing program. The Storyboard above shows 5 different views with descriptions to each as follows:
- NYC-Checkout Times for Users: In this chart we are able to see the majority of users using the Citi bikes typically use them for about 5 minutes at a time, some as long as 10 minutes. This gives us the idea that users within this duration are potentially used as a mode of transport to get to and from work to help avoid the larger pedestrian amounts walking a few blocks to get to their destination.
- NYC-Checkout Times by Gender: This chart shows the vast majority of Citi bike users are male. In the area of Manhattan where this data is based from, working class women are usually be seen in suits, skirts or dresses and wearing stylish high heels. These outfits are not the best to wear when trying to commute to work on a bike, which we feel is what would add to this large swing in gender use.
- NYC-Trips by Weekday per Hour: With this heatmap chart we can cleary determine that the most popular times for the Citi bike trips are around 7:00AM - 9:00AM and 5:00PM - 7:00PM on weekdays. This information solidifies the belief that most of these daily users are utilizing the bikeshare to commute to and from work. On weekend days, we see more activity from roughly 10:00AM - 7:00PM which may show those from out of town and tourists that utilize the Citi bikes to perhaps get the best views of the city while exploring on their visit.
- NYC-Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): In this heatmap we can see what we already knew from the previous Gender chart; the majority of users are Male. This helps solidify that females in this area of NYC may not be dressed appropriately or feel comfortable using the Citi bike's to commute to and from work.
- NTY-User Trips by Gender by Weekday: With this chart we can determine which users are subscribers rather than just occasional users. Males are our highest subscriber on average for most of the week. We can determine that the majority of users of the Citi bikes are subscribers and "returning" users.

### Summary and Suggestions

In summary, the Citi Bikeshare program is most utilized by subscribers that appear to be local males that are commuting to and from work. This helps get an idea on where to market the Citi bikes to advertise for potential future subscribers, and shows that we do not need to rely heavily on tourism which provides a solid market structure that is less volatile.

The two charts below, show the top starting and ending locations for Citi Bikeshare users of NYC. My recommendation is to have a few areas in Des Moines to test where to have the placement for the bike stations. The bikes in NYC are typically used for commuting to work, so I'd recommend looking into any financial district to start and determine the most populated office areas. This would give us an idea on the prime location for the best results in the Des Moines market space.
